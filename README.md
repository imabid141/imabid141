# Hi there 👋 I am Ghulam Muhammad
### AI-Driven Blue Team Engineer | Building Agentic SOC Automation

**Core Stack:** LangChain | LangGraph | Python | Docker | Wazuh | Linux  

---

## 🧠 About Me

I focus on designing **Agent-Based Blue Team (SOC) systems** that combine detection engineering with modern LLM reasoning frameworks.

My work centers around understanding how intelligent agents can:

- Analyze security logs
- Perform structured reasoning
- Execute automated playbooks
- Generate explainable SOC reports

I am currently mastering **LangChain and LangGraph** to build production-ready AI agents for cybersecurity automation.

## 🎯 Current Focus

- LangChain (LCEL, Chains, Agents)
- Structured outputs & tool calling
- Multi-agent orchestration (LangGraph)
- Observability with LangSmith
- Applying LLM reasoning to security log analysis

## 🛡️ Cybersecurity Foundation

- SOC Operations & Blue Team methodology
- Log analysis & threat detection logic
- Wazuh (Open Source XDR / SIEM)
- Detection engineering concepts
- Linux & networking fundamentals
- Python-based security automation
